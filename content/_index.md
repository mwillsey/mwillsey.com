I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington
[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering][allen].
I work between the [PLSE][], [MISL][], and [Sampa][] groups applying programming
language techniques to problems in architecture and synthetic biology.

I'm currently working on programming models for microfluidic chips. These
architectures promise to make labs-on-a-chip (LoCs) scalable and affordable, but
issues like high error rates, resource management, and concurrency make them
difficult to program. The [Puddle][] framework aims to provide a safer, easier
way to program these devices.

Outside of work, I enjoy [running][rcr], reading, and crosswords.
I (with the help of several others) maintain [crossbot][], your friendly neighborhood crossword-tracking robot.
