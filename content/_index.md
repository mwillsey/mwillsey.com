I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington
[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering][allen].
I work between the [PLSE][] and [MISL][] groups
using programming language techniques in conventional and
unconventional domains.

I'm currently working on programming models for microfluidic chips. These
architectures promise to make labs-on-a-chip (LoCs) scalable and affordable, but
issues like high error rates, resource management, and concurrency make them
difficult to program. The [Puddle][] framework aims to provide a safer, easier
way to program these devices.

## News

- 2020 Apr
  - I've been working on this e-graph library called 
    [egg](https://github.com/mwillsey/egg) for a while.
    I and my fellow egg-heads put out a 
    [paper](/papers/egg)
    describing the system and some of its novel ideas.
    
- 2020 Mar
  - Some friends and I wrote a fun [paper](/papers/pldi-szalinski) about
    synthesizing 3D CAD models. It will appear (virtually!) at PLDI 2020.

- 2019 Dec
  - I passed my generals exam, so I’m now a PhD candidate!

- 2019 Oct
  - I’ll be speaking at a
    [special session](https://iccad.com/event_details?id=283-9-B)
    on the future of microfludics at
    [ICCAD 2019](https://www.iccad.com).
    You can check out the paper
    [here](/papers/iccad-puddle).

- 2019 Apr
  - I’m very excited to be speaking at the
    [Biochips Summer School](http://biochips-summerschool.strikingly.com/)
    at CU Boulder. I’ll be joining a bunch of other exciting speakers
    to talk about building, programming, and using digital
    microfluidic devices. Check it out!
  - The Allen School put together a nice
    [news piece](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2019/04/15/uw-and-microsoft-researchers-demonstrate-digital-microfluidics-automation-for-scaling-dna-data-storage/)
    on some of our recent work, including our ASPLOS and Nature
    Communications papers.

- 2019 Mar
  - I’ll be giving two talks at
    [ASPLOS 2019](https://www.asplos-conference.org/)!
    In the technical track, I’ll talk about
    [Puddle](/papers/asplos-puddle/),
    our new microfluidic programming system. Later in the Wild and
    Crazy Ideas track, I’ll start a discussion about
    [cloud scale microfluidics](/papers/waci-megamicrofluidics/).

- 2019 Jan
  - I’m super excited to be co-teaching CSE 351 this quarter with
    [Luis](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/)!
    This course covers the hardware-software interface including
    C, assembly, virtual memory, caches, and so on.
  - Some folks in the [MISL] group put together a
    [paper](http://127.0.0.1:5000/papers/pieee-hybrid-molecular/)
    about our vision of a hybrid molecular-electronic computing
    platform. It’s in the January 2019 issue of the Proceedings of the
    IEEE.
