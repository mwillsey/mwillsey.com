<section id="intro">

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington
[Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering][allen].
I work between the [PLSE][] and [MISL][] groups
using programming language techniques in conventional and
unconventional domains.

I'm currently working on programming models for microfluidic chips. These
architectures promise to make labs-on-a-chip (LoCs) scalable and affordable, but
issues like high error rates, resource management, and concurrency make them
difficult to program. The [Puddle][] framework aims to provide a safer, easier
way to program these devices.
